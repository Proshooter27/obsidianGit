I Ojas Patil have decided to work toward a grade of A in English 100. I understand that if I do not complete the work for the grade I have selected, I will receive a lower grade, and that I may receive a grade lower than a B if I do not satisfy the requirements of B work.

**Reflection:**
Upon reviewing my grading contract, I've successfully fulfilled most of my commitments, with the exception of attendance. I experienced an illness that resulted in two absences, which the professor excused, but it still meant I fell short of my attendance goal. However, I'm genuinely proud of the writing I've produced in this class. Prior to this course, my writing experience was limited, and I never anticipated developing the skills I have. I'm especially pleased with the progress I've made in articulating my ideas. As I move into the second half of the semester, I want to continue refining my writing skills, focusing on honing my ability and exploring different approaches to composition. My goal is to maximize this opportunity to further develop my writing and analytical abilities.
