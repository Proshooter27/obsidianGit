- A minterm is a product term (an AND) containing all the variables or their complements
- For a n-variable function, there are 2<sup>n</sup> possible minterms

> Minterms are always associated with the value 1.
> If we are supposed to represent a boolean function, minterms represent the values 1.

### It's Function:
- As mention in the disclaimer above minterms can be used to represent functions

**An Example:**

> We can convert to [[Maxterms]] from Minterms by using De Morgan's Law from [[Basic Boolean Identities]]
