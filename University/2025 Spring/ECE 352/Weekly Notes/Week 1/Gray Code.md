Sequence where the next value is always **exactly one** bit different

- Sequence: (00,01,11,10,00,...)

#### Why Gray Code?
- Used when we want to avoid multiple bit changes for any step of the counting sequence
	- Minimizes uncertainty during transition
	- Save power/energy of transitions
	- Potentially simplifies circuitry
	- Needed for [[Boolean Algebra]] simplification in [[Karnaugh Maps]]
