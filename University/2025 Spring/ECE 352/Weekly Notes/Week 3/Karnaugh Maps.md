- It is a visual representation of a boolean function.
- It represents the information as a truth table but its organized in a different way.

K-maps are arranged in a way that it is easy to represent minterms (aka [[Gray Code]])

K-maps help in simplifying a boolean function

> A value of 0 represents the complement of a variable and A value of 1 represents a variable.


## Usage of a K-Map:

### Rules for K-Map Groupings:
1. Minimum group size is 1x1.
2. We can increase the size of a group by doubling its dimensions.
	- We can also wrap around k-map groups by sides or by the corners.
3. Groups must be rectangular shapes with each side a power-of-two.
4. **It is always better to have bigger groups and less number of groups to get the most efficient circuit.**
