Defined by a truth table, which is the complete representation of a boolean function

It is similar to *regular* algebra but works with variables that can only be 0's and 1's

This allows us to manipulate boolean functions
- Circuit/logic minimization
- Identify shared sub-functions (shared circuitry)
- Verify functionality
- Transform to use other types of gates or structures
