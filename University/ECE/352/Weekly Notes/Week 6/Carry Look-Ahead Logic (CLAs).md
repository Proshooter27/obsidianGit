When we make a CLA, we trade of area/power to get a faster speed.

Each carry bit is a **multi-level** function of the generates and propagates of the lower positions

We can now convert the above Ripple-Carry Adder by opening up the parenthesis.

Now, the **“Flatten”** the ripple-carry equation equates to 2-levels of logic for every C<sub>out</sub>.


### Extending the idea of CLAs
We can't always keep on extending the chain everytime we need more bits. So, to solve that issue
