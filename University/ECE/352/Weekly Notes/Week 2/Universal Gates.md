It is a gate or group of gates that can implement **all** the basic boolean operations
- **AND, OR, NOT** are together universal
- **NAND, NOR** are each universal

We can use an visual approach by drawing the circuit to show that a circuit is universal.

## How to prove a gate is universal?
By using one or more of a certain *"M-Gate"* to implement either:
- NOT and OR
- NOT and AND
- NAND
- NOR
