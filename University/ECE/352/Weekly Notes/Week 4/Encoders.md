- Performs the reverse operation of a decoder.
- Takes up to 2<sup>n</sup> inputs and produces s n-bit output

> However, if you have Multiple 1 bit inputs or zero 1 bit inputs, it would give you an erroneous output value. That's where **priority encoders** come into the picture

## Priority Encoders
It resolves the issue by assigning each bit a priority.
