- How fast can we clock a sequential circuit?
![[Pasted image 20250406181908.png]]
- The answer depends on both the flip-flop timing parameters and the delays of combinational logic elements in the circuit
	- Flip-flop output changes must propagate through the circuit to the flip-flop inputs before the next clock edge

#### Minimum Clock Period (t<sub>min</sub>)
