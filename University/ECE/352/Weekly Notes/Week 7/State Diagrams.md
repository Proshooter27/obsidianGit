- A graphical depiction of the [[Sequential Circuits#State Tables|state tables]]
- Circles represent the states in the diagram
	- In an FSM circuit with N flip-flops, the state is encoded as an N-bit binary number
		- N bits can represent up to 2<sup>N</sup> states
- Directed lines represent the state transitions
	- Arrows indicate the direction of the transition
	- Labeled with input value(s) that cause the transition
	- Each line of the state table corresponds to a transition
- Circuit outputs shown where they are relevant
	- [[Moore Machines]]: inside the state circle
	- [[Mealy Machines]]: on the transitions
