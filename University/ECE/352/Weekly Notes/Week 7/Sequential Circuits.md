#### Definitions:
1. Combinational Circuit: Outputs are a function of **only current** circuit inputs
2. Sequential Circuits: Outputs are a function of **not only the current** circuit inputs but also what has happened in the **past**

### Finite State Machines (FSMs)
A sequential circuit that has a **finite** number of possible states
- Limited by the number of flip-flops in the circuit
