Sometimes we don't care about the inputs or the outputs of certain functions for certain conditions, that's when we consider the values of them to be **X**.

> X is technically not a output value but it can be value fixed to 1 or 0 so that we can simplify our circuit.

### Example:

- All the X's in the groups are considered to be a 1 while the X's out of the groups are considered to be a 0.
